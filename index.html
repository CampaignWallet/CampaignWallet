        <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
        <p>Campaign finance information, generally speaking, is inaccessible to the average voter,
          and the politicians have little to no incentive to improve its accessibility. </p>

        <h2>What's Out There Now</h2>
        <p>
          Current campaign finance law at the federal level requires candidate committees, party committees, 
          and PACs to file periodic reports disclosing the money they raise and spend. 
          Federal candidate committees must identify, for example, all PACs and party committees that give them
          contributions, and they must provide the names, occupations, employers and addresses of all
          individuals who give them more than $200 in an election cycle.
          The <a href="https://www.fec.gov/">Federal Elections Commisions</a> is an independent regulatory
          agency of the United States whose purpose is to enforce campaign finance law in United States federal 
          elections.
          They maintain the database of campaign finance data. 
          (View it <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/">here!</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
          Various organizations, including <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/">OpenSecrets</a>, 
          aggregate FEC data on political contributions to provide insight into the influence of various groups.
          OpenSecrets is a nonpartisan nonprofit aimed at tracking money in U.S. politics and its effect 
          on elections and public policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the data is currently available through the FEC and sites like OpenSecrets, 
          it is often hard to search for the precise bit information one is interested in.
          Once found, the data usually is difficult to interpret.
        </p>

        <h1 id="our-solution">Our Solution</h1>
        <p>
          This project aims to improve transparency and accessibility in campaign finance information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our chrome extension allows users to hover over or click on the names of members of Congress on any 
          website and see a popup providing campaign finance statistics.
          It uses the OpenSecrets API to pull information from the official FEC database.
          After retrieving the data, our extension processes the data and presents an intuitive summary of the
          key details. 
          In doing so, we hope to encourage more Americans to pay attention to their representative's finances
          and make informed voting decisions.
