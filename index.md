# About Our Project
The project aims to improve transparency in campaign finance information. 

## The Problem
This information, generally speaking, is inaccessible to the average voter and the politicians have little to no incentive to improve its accessibility. 

## The Solution
Our chrome extension allows users to hover over the names of members of Congress on any website and see a popup providing campaign finance statistics.
